-------------------------> if user changes , redirect him to login page , this component is fixed for every route or component <--------------------
// points to be noted : 
// add expenses : maximum amount should be fixed , otherwise user may enter 100000000000000000000000000000000000000000000 and also while entering amount if he enters 0.01 , after splitting it into half , it is like 0.000300000000000005 
//                Can be able to add expenses from home by selecting friends , or  adding expenses for multiple friends at a time . ---> lentedTo becomes array 


// edit : two transactions are settled , user changed one transaction to make them imbalance , and we know it comes back to expenses , what if he again balances those two transactions by just updating them as it was before , --> then they should go to their places right ? 
// -----------------error handling ---------------->
// what if user delete entire transaction : all comments should also be deleted

owner pays amount , and he wants to delete it , then owe - lented
friend paid amount he wants to delete it,then lented + paid



// after clicking on the save button while adding trans ... it's better to close the popUp immediately , otherwise user might tap on save multiple times while the previous one is under process


// work on diff shimmers , errors

--------------------------------------------------> Bugs <----------------------------------------
if user delete trans from all expenses , everthing messes up , 
what if he is trying to delete allready settled trans , (but we will get clicked as all instead of settle)
shit bro : 
let's say you both settled , 
and user deleted a trans from allexpenses (but our transactions are settled : which means we don't have anything in expenses : and that to we are sending clicked as "all" , so it won't push unbalanced transactions to expenses again , but owe will be changed ) 
NOW : we have nothing in expenses (which we should have basically (because we are not settled)),
Now : if user tried to delete from all expenses to make it settle : (since we are settled : we are pushing all our expenses to settledTrans) : Lol we have nothing in expenses , as we didn't updated unbalanced trans back to expenses , and lol everthing transactions ,  gone
